\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present DETR-HF, a head-only fine-tuning approach for the Detection Transformer (DETR) model with a ResNet-50 backbone, tailored for object detection in military and drone imagery. By freezing the backbone and transformer layers, we train only the classification and bounding box prediction heads on a custom dataset, enhancing computational efficiency while adapting to domain-specific classes such as tanks, drones, people, and soldiers. We introduce a custom military dataset for evaluation, drawing inspiration from real-world industrial anomaly detection challenges. Results are benchmarked against baseline metrics on publicly available datasets, showcasing effective transfer learning.

\section{Introduction}

In computer vision, object detection identifies and localizes instances of predefined classes within images, a task critical for applications such as surveillance \cite{piciarelli2008}, defect detection \cite{mishra2019}, and military reconnaissance \cite{li2022}. The Detection Transformer (DETR) \cite{carion2020} revolutionizes this field by treating detection as a set prediction problem, leveraging a ResNet backbone and transformer architecture to eliminate traditional components like anchor boxes and non-maximum suppression.

Recent advancements focus on efficient fine-tuning of transformer models, particularly in resource-constrained environments like edge deployments. Most approaches retrain entire networks, but we propose DETR-HF, which learns the manifold of military classes in a semi-supervised manner, fine-tuning only the output heads. This method is motivated by the need for rapid adaptation to custom datasets in defense applications. Figure \ref{fig:samples} illustrates sample detections from our approach.

\section{Related Work}

Object detection has progressed from region-based methods like Faster R-CNN to single-stage detectors like YOLO. Transformer-based models, introduced by Vaswani et al. \cite{vaswani2017}, extended to vision with DETR \cite{carion2020}, utilize ResNet for feature extraction and transformers for set prediction.

Transfer learning adapts pre-trained models efficiently \cite{howard2018}. Freezing lower layers to preserve general features, as demonstrated by Zhu et al. \cite{zhu2021}, reduces overfitting on small datasets. In military contexts, datasets like MVTec \cite{bergmann2019} inspire our custom set, focusing on drones and vehicles \cite{li2022}. Anomaly detection parallels our work, with VT-ADL \cite{mishra2021} employing transformers for localization, which we adapt for standard detection with head-only fine-tuning.

\section{Proposed Model}

The DETR-HF model adapts DETR by freezing the ResNet-50 backbone and transformer, fine-tuning only the classification and box prediction heads. Input images \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C} \) are processed through the backbone to extract features.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Backbone}: ResNet-50 extracts convolutional features, frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge.
    \item \textbf{Transformer Encoder}: Encodes features with multi-head self-attention, preserving positional information via embeddings (eq. \ref{eq:embedding}). Frozen.
    \[
    Z_0 = [X_p E; \ldots] + E_{pos} \quad (1)
    \]
    Multi-head attention and MLP blocks follow \cite{vaswani2017}.
    \item \textbf{Decoder}: Transformer decoder predicts object queries, frozen.
    \item \textbf{Heads}: Classification head: Linear(256, num_classes=4). Box head: MLP(256$\rightarrow$256$\rightarrow$256$\rightarrow$4).
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:model} provides an overview.

\end{figure}

\section{Training and Evaluation}

Training minimizes DETR's set loss, combining classification and bipartite matching via the Hungarian algorithm.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Losses}: Cross-entropy for classes; L1 + Generalized IoU (GIoU) for boxes.
    \[
    L = \lambda_{cls} L_{cls} + \lambda_{box} L_{box} \quad (2)
    \]
    \item \textbf{Optimizer}: Adam, lr=1e-4.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation}: mAP@0.5, precision, recall, F1. Custom metrics via IoU matching (threshold=0.5).
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Results}

We evaluate on custom and baseline datasets.

\subsection{Datasets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Custom Military}: 2830 images of tanks (0), drones (1), people (2), soldiers (3). Train/Val/Test splits.
    \item \textbf{MVTec}: Adapted for detection, resized to 320x320.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

Training loss decreases (Fig. \ref{fig:loss}).

        \hline
        Tank & 0.1900 \\
        Drone & 0.1506 \\
        People & 0.4674 \\

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Per-class AP.}
    \label{tab:ap}
\end{table}

Compared to full fine-tuning, DETR-HF is more efficient.
